1. version a(one loop version)

2. I preper version b, which is one loop version.       
   Since "version b" uses Daisy-chaining if, which executes selected line 
   depending on the condition. On the contrary, "version a" executes whole 
   lines of the code inside of the if statement. In version b, it is also 
   easier to see how the code works, since it has only one loop and uses
   scanner only once per loop.
