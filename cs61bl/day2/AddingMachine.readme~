1. version a(one loop version)

2. I preper version b, which is one loop version.       
   Since "version b" uses Daisy-chaining if, which executes selected line 
   depending on the condition. On the contrary, "version a" uses nested if, 
   which executes whole lines of the code inside of the if statement.
